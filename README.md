# Credit Card Fraud Detection using SSVDD

This is a part of the Credit card fraud detection research project, available [HERE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14880). In the project, different variants of many one class classification models were implemented. This code is an initial version of the SSVDD model used for the study mentioned before. It also serves as a demo of the python implementation of [SSVDD](https://github.com/Zaffarr/SSVDD_Python) model.
